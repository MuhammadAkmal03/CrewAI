## Deploying Streamlit Apps Online: A Step-by-Step Guide
Deploying a Streamlit app online can seem like a daunting task, especially for those who are new to the platform. However, with the Streamlit Community Cloud, the process is straightforward and requires minimal technical expertise. In this blog post, we will walk you through the steps to deploy a Streamlit app online and share it with others.

### Creating a GitHub Repository
The first step in deploying a Streamlit app online is to create a GitHub repository. This can be done by going to the GitHub website and creating a new repository. Once the repository is created, you can upload your Streamlit app files to it. This can be done by dragging and dropping the files into the repository or by using the terminal. Make sure to upload all the necessary files, including the main app file, to the repository.

### Linking the Repository to the Streamlit Community Cloud
Once the repository is set up, you can link it to the Streamlit Community Cloud website. This is done by going to the Streamlit Community Cloud website and selecting the "New App" option. You will then be prompted to select the repository that contains your Streamlit app files. Select the repository and update the main file path to point to the main app file.

### Deploying the App
After linking the repository to the Streamlit Community Cloud, you can deploy the app by selecting the "Deploy" option. The app will then be baked and deployed online. If any errors occur during the deployment process, you can fix them by reuploading the corrected files to GitHub and rebooting the app.

### Testing the App Locally
The key to a successful deployment is to ensure that the app is tested locally on the computer before attempting to upload it to the Community Cloud. This helps to prevent any errors that may occur during the deployment process. By testing the app locally, you can identify and fix any issues before deploying the app online.

### Key Takeaways
Here are the five key takeaways from the process:
* Create a GitHub repository to hold the Streamlit app files
