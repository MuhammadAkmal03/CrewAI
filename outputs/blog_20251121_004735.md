# The Limitations of Large Language Models: How to Make Them Understand Your Context
## Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) with their ability to generate human-like text and answer complex questions. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have limitations when it comes to understanding specific contexts and data. One of the major problems with LLMs is hallucination, where they provide confident but incorrect answers. This can be frustrating and even dangerous in certain applications, such as healthcare or finance. In this blog post, we will explore the limitations of LLMs and discuss two solutions to this problem: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## The Problem of Hallucination
Hallucination occurs when an LLM provides an answer that is not based on any actual data or evidence. This can happen when the model is not trained on a specific dataset or when it is not able to understand the context of the question. For example, if you ask an LLM to answer a question about a specific company, it may provide an answer that is not based on any actual information about the company, but rather on its general knowledge of companies. This can be misleading and even harmful if the answer is used to make important decisions.

## Fine-Tuning: A Solution to Hallucination
One solution to the problem of hallucination is fine-tuning. Fine-tuning involves retraining the LLM on a specific dataset, such as a collection of documents or a database. This allows the model to learn the specific context and terminology of the dataset and provide more accurate answers. Fine-tuning can be time-consuming and expensive, as it requires a large amount of computational resources and expertise. However, it can be an effective way to improve the accuracy of an LLM and reduce the risk of hallucination.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A More Efficient Solution
Another solution to the problem of hallucination is RAG. RAG is a technique that uses a context engine to provide the LLM with relevant information at runtime. This allows the model to generate answers that are based on actual data and evidence, rather than just its general knowledge. RAG is a more efficient and cost-effective approach than fine-tuning, as it does not require retraining the model on a specific dataset. Instead, it uses a vector database to store and retrieve relevant information, allowing the model to generate answers quickly and accurately.

## The RAG Pipeline
The RAG pipeline involves several steps:
1. **Data Intake**: The first step in the RAG pipeline is data intake, where the model ingests a large amount of data, such as documents or databases.
2. **Chunking**: The data is then broken down into smaller chunks, such as sentences or paragraphs.
3. **Embedding**: Each chunk is then embedded into a vector space, where it is represented as a numerical vector.
4. **Vector Storage**: The vectors are then stored in a vector database, where they can be retrieved quickly and efficiently.
5. **Retrieval**: When a question is asked, the model retrieves the relevant vectors from the database and uses them to generate an answer.
6. **Synthesis**: The final step is synthesis, where the model combines the retrieved information to generate a final answer.

## Benefits of RAG
RAG has several benefits, including:
* **Fast Iterations**: RAG allows for fast iterations, as the model can generate answers quickly and accurately without requiring retraining.
* **Cheap Infrastructure**: RAG is a cost-effective approach, as it does not require expensive computational resources or expertise.
* **Always-Fresh Information**: RAG provides always-fresh information, as the model can retrieve the latest information from the database and generate answers based on that.

## Building a Chatbot with RAG
RAG can be used to build a chatbot that can answer questions based on specific documents. For example, a company can use RAG to build a chatbot that can answer questions about its products or services. The chatbot can be trained on a dataset of documents, such as product manuals or customer support tickets, and can generate answers based on that information. This can be a powerful tool for customer support, as it allows customers to get quick and accurate answers to their questions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, LLMs have limitations when it comes to understanding specific contexts and data, leading to hallucination. Fine-tuning and RAG are two solutions to this problem, with RAG being a more efficient and cost-effective approach. The RAG pipeline involves data intake, chunking, embedding, vector storage, retrieval, and synthesis, and provides fast iterations, cheap infrastructure, and always-fresh information. RAG can be used to build a chatbot that can answer questions based on specific documents, and has the potential to revolutionize the field of NLP. By using RAG, companies and organizations can build more accurate and effective AI models that can provide value to their customers and users.
